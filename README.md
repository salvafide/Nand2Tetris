# Nand2Tetris
 Projects for the nand2tetris course. The course covers:

 <b>Hardware</b>: Boolean arithmetic, combinational logic, sequential logic, designs and implementation of logic gates, multiplexors, flip-flops, registers,RAMunits, counters, Hardware Description Language (HDL), chip simulation, verification and testing.

 <b>Architecture</b>: ALU/CPU design and implementation, clocks and cycles, addressing modes, fetch and execute logic, instruction set,  memory-mapped input/output (I/O).
 
 <b>Low-level languages:</b> Design and implementation of a simple machine language(binary and symbolic), instruction sets, assembly programming, assemblers.

 <b>Virtual Machines:</b> stack-based automata, stack arithmatic, function call and return, handling recursion, design and implementation of a simple VM language.

<b>High-level languages</b>: Design and implementation of a simple object-based, Java-like langauge: abstract data types, classes, constructors, methods, scoping rules, syntax and semantics, references.

<b>Compilers</b>: Lexical analysis, parsing, symbol tables, code generation, implementation of arrays and objects, two-tier compilation.

<b>Programming</b>: Implementation of an assembler, virtual machine, and compiler, following supplied APIs.

<b>Operating systems</b>: Design and implementation of memory management, math library,  input/output drivers, string processing, textual output, graphical output, high-level language support.
 
<b>Data structures and algorithms</b>: Stacks, hash tables, lists, trees, arithmetic algorithms, running time considerations.

<b>Software engineering</b>: Modular design, the interface/implementation paradigm, API design and documentation, proactive test planning, quality assurance, programming at the large.
